  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p>Effective Date: October 2025</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Talk Buddy</strong> (developed by Diogo Tahal) collects, uses, and protects information when you use this service.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>Talk Buddy does not collect or store any personally identifiable information. Any text or audio you provide is processed securely through OpenAI’s systems to generate educational responses. No data is permanently stored by the developer.</p>

  <h2>2. How Information Is Used</h2>
  <p>Input data is used only to create conversational and learning responses within the current session. It is not used for marketing, tracking, or resale purposes.</p>

  <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>Talk Buddy uses OpenAI’s API and possibly Vercel hosting. These services may temporarily process data to provide functionality but do not have access to user identities.</p>

  <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>No personal data is retained after each session ends. All interactions are ephemeral.</p>

  <h2>5. Cookies</h2>
  <p>The Talk Buddy web app itself does not use cookies. However, hosting providers like Vercel may use standard cookies for performance and analytics.</p>

  <h2>6. Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, you can contact the developer at:
     <a href="mailto:diogotahal@gmail.com">diogotahal@gmail.com</a>
  </p>

  <h2>7. Updates</h2>
  <p>This policy may be updated occasionally to reflect new features or hosting changes. Updates will be published on this same page.</p>
